GoBrief! is an application that interfaces with the NOAA's official website aviationweather.gov

## Rationale

---

I use aviationweather.gov everytime I plan a flight, but I have a few issues with it:

- Lack of savable presets
- It's a bit slow
- Information is all over the place

Obviously, I'm opinionated. But, I would like a system where I can have all my preferred weather sources (TAFs, SIGMETs, freezing levels, etc.) **AND** have them saved so I can easily retrieve all pertinent information relating to the flight.
